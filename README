What The Fu..
=============

This is an attempt to make a game that will generate Touhou-style bullet-hell bosses and then breed/mutate them depending on how well they fare against players.

For those unfamiliar with the bullet-hell genre, it is a subgenre of the shoot-em-up genre, focused more on dodging bullets than anything else.
The reason it's called a bullet hell is because at any given time, the screen will be covered with enemy bullets.

The "fitness function" is the score the boss gets in playing against the player.  
Because it would be exceptionally boring and time consuming to do this on one's own, The idea is to play this on network.  
The Jar files in the root folder are the Jar and Runnable Client Jar files.

EvolvingShooterRunnableClient.jar will attempt to connect to a server at the default address and the default port. It's meant as an end-user runner. Unfortunately, it won't do much as of now, because there is no central server.


But, How Do I..
===============
EvolvingShooter.jar is the all-purpose jarfile.  
Run Server: java -jar EvolvingShooter.jar -s [port]  
Run Client: java -jar EvolvingShooter.jar -c [address] [port]  
Run Client/Server Hybrid: java -jar EvolvingShooter.jar -sc [address] [port]

if no value is given for [address], it will default to localhost.  
if no value is given for [port], it will default to 1337




What is Going On?
=================
yeah, it's a little confusing. Keep reading, I swear I explain it.

###BOSS STATS
The way a boss behaves is determined by two things: its attack pattern and its base stats.
The base stats are broken down into 6 stats:

STR: (Strength) controls damage the boss does, and contributes to the size of its hitbox  
CON: (Constitution) controls the max Hitpoints of the boss, and contributes to the size of its hitbox  
INT: (Intelligence) controls the maximum mana of the boss  
WIS: (Wisdom) controls the mana regeneration rate of the boss  
DEX: (Dexterity) controls firing speed and contributes to the movement speed of the boss  
LUK: (Luck) controls the bullet travel speed and contributes to the movement speed of the boss  

A boss's stats are pulled in ratios from a common "nutrient" pool. A boss can only put so many points into all the stats combined.

###IN GAME UI INFORMATION
There's a lot of information being fed to you at any given time about the stats of the boss and bullets.

The color denotes the stat distribution of the boss.
STR and CON increase the red channel
LUK and DEX increase the green channel
INT and WIS increase the blue channel

Moreover, the shape of the boss will tell you a little more about its stats:  
the size of the boss is determined by its CON  
the number of spikes on the boss is determined by its LUK  
the extremeness of each of those spikes is determined by the ratio of DEX to STR.  


the bars at the top of the combat area are the health and mana of the boss's current form.  
A boss has 3 forms -> when a form is defeated, the boss's health is restored and it changes its attack pattern. Mana, however, is maintained across forms.

To the right of the playing area are the player statistics.  
The bar is the health of the player, which is always out of 100pts  
the squares beneath the bar are ammunition for bombs. A player starts with 3 bombs, and can hold up to 10 (though no method for recovering bombs has been implemented)

The number displayed on the right is the current score of the boss.

###GALLERY SCREEN
the gallery screen is a place to see all the bosses that have been generated up till now in the game. As of now it loads all the bosses that have been generated, ever.  
At some point I will go back and fix that, but it hasn't been an issue on my solo testing, mainly because I keep changing up the boss code, which invalidates my savefiles.  

At any rate, the grey circles around the bosses indicate the two top scoring bosses in that generation. Those are the bosses that were (or most are most likely to be) bred to form the next generation.

The final boss in any generation is randomly generated, to try and inject/maintain genetic diversity as near optimal things are reached.

###CONTROLS
Z: shoot  
X: drop bomb.  
(bombs clear out a large area around the player of the boss's bullets)

Left/Right/Up/Down: Move  
Spacebar: Move quickly  
Ctrl: Move slowly  
(the purpose of multiple movement speeds is to allow for precision navigation of bullet patterns)

CLOSING
=======
Everything is more or less totally unbalanced, so I apologize in advance for that. I am aware that INT and WIS are pretty much just dump stats as of now. This was not originally the case, but I cut mana costs to the point of their irrelivence.
